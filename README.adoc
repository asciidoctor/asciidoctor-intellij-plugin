= IntelliJ AsciiDoc Plugin
Erik Pragt
:experimental:

A plugin for the IntelliJ platform (IntelliJ IDEA, RubyMine, etc) that provides support for the http://www.asciidoc.org[AsciiDoc] markup language. You can install the plugin (named "AsciiDoc") from the plugins section inside your Jetbrains IDE or download it from the https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7391[Jetbrains Plugin Repository]. 

If you want to use the JavaFX instead of the Swing preview, you'll need to run IntelliJ with 64bit Java.
If your IntelliJ distribution doesn't come with 64bit Java, you'll need to have an environment variable `IDEA_JDK` or `IDEA_JDK64` pointing to the installation folder of a 64bit Java.
See https://intellij-support.jetbrains.com/hc/en-us/articles/206544879-Selecting-the-JDK-version-the-IDE-will-run-under[Jetbrains support database] for more information.
