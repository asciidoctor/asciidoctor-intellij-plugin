[FILES]
# Files to include in the minified installation:
# one glob pattern per line, relative to the MathJax directory.
# If a directory is named, or glob expansion matches a directory,
# the contents of that directory will be included recursively.
# See https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax-docs/wiki/Guide%3A-reducing-size-of-a-mathjax-installation
# for instructions on how to adjust the included files to your needs.
#
# The example configuration, below, assumes the following MathJax
# configuration:
# <script type="text/x-mathjax-config">
# MathJax.Hub.Config({
#   messageStyle: "none",
#   tex2jax: {
#     inlineMath: [["\\(", "\\)"]],
#     displayMath: [["\\[", "\\]"]],
#     ignoreClass: "nostem|nolatexmath"
#   },
#   asciimath2jax: {
#     delimiters: [["\\$", "\\$"]],
#     ignoreClass: "nostem|noasciimath"
#   },
#   TeX: { equationNumbers: { autoNumber: "none" } }
# });
# MathJax.Hub.Config({
#    extensions: ["MatchWebFonts.js"],
#    MathMenu: { showLocale: false }
# })
# </script>
# <script src="/path/to/MathJax/MathJax.js?config=TeX-MML-AM_HTMLorMML"></script>
#
# This configuration may not be 100% minimal; in particular, there may be
# individual .js modules redundant to the combined configuration file.

# pushing STIX as a webfont.
