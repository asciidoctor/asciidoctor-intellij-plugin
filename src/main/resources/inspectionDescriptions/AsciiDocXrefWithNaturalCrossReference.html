An xref macro should not contain a natural cross reference.
<!-- tooltip end -->
A natural cross reference is a reference repeating the section heading including its blanks and capitalization.
This should only be used within pointy brackes (<code>&lt;&lt;...&gt;&gt;</code>), not within an xref.
To use an xref, use the explicit ID of the section instead.
<p/>
While natural references work for Asciidoctor as of version 2.0.10, this is an unintended behavior.
This behavior might be removed in a future release, see <a
        href="https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-intellij-plugin/issues/546">GitHub issue
    asciidoctor/asciidoctor-intellij-plugin/#546</a> for details.
