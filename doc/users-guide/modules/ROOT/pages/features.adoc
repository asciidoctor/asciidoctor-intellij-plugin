== Benefits of this plugin

The IntelliJ AsciiDoc Plugin adds to your IDE:

* A context-sensitive editor with syntax highlighting, auto-completion and in-line validation messages.
* A configurable preview to proofread and navigate the content.
* Integrations to a Markdown-to-AsciiDoc converter, in-line diagrams like PlantUML, xref:features/advanced/antora.adoc[Antora, a static site generator], and xref:features/advanced/spring-rest-docs.adoc[Spring REST docs].
* xref:features/advanced/creating-html-and-pdf.adoc[Convert AsciiDoc files to HTML and PDF files] from within the IDE.

== Context-sensitive editor

* Recognizes the AsciiDoc file extension (.adoc, .asciidoc, .ad)
* Toolbar and context menu for basic formatting and to create tables.

Learn more about it in the xref:features/editor.adoc[] section.

== Configurable preview

* Provides a two-pane AsciiDoc preview editor based on https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctorj[AsciidoctorJ] with live preview.

By default, it has a vertical split and the preview is on the right.
Use the settings to flip editor and preview and change to a horizontal split.

Learn more about it in the xref:features/preview.adoc[] section.

== Integrations to the AsciiDoc ecosystem

These supports undo when you're not happy with the result.
