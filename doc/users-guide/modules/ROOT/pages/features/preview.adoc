:navtitle: Preview

== Overview

By default, the preview is on the right side of a vertical split screen.
Using the configuration, the user can change the split to horizontal, and change the position of the preview.

The plugin uses https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctorj[AsciidoctorJ] 2.x to render the preview.

By default, the plugin runs Asciidoctor in safe mode _UNSAFE_ which is also the default when a user runs Asciidoctor from the command line.
The user can change the behavior to other modes like _SAVE_, _SERVER_ and _SECURE_ in the plugin's settings.
See section https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#running-asciidoctor-securely[Running Asciidoctor securely in the Asciidoctor User Manual] for more information about this feature.

When using the JCEF of the JavaFX preview and the safe mode setting _SAVE_, _SERVER_ or _SECURE_, remote content is no longer allowed in the preview.
With this setting the plugin applies a Content Security Policy to prevent this (new in plugin version 0.32.32).

When the user enters formulas using Asciidoctor's math support, the preview renders them using MathML.
If the formula can't be parsed by MathML, the preview shows an error popup.

When the user moves the cursor in the editor, the preview scrolls the text into the preview.

When the user clicks on text in the preview, the editor moves the cursor to the clicked text.
This is accurate at block level, unfortunately not yet on line or character level.
If the content of the preview is part of an included file, the editor opens the included file (new in plugin version 0.32.5).

When the user clicks on an external URL, the preview opens it in an external browser.

When the user clicks on a relative link within the project (usually a `\link:[]` reference), the preview opens the referenced file in a new editor.

When the user right-clicks on an image, the editor shows a dialog to save the file to the local file system.
For diagrams like PlantUML it offers to save the files as PNG or SVG.
Windows and Linux users have a drop down menu for this.
MacOS users need to type the extension for the target file name (`.svg` or `.png`)

The user can zoom in and out of the preview by holding kbd:[Ctrl] and scrolling the mouse wheel up or down.
Clicking the middle mouse button whilst holding kbd:[Ctrl] resets the zoom to 100%.

== Advanced

The preview can use custom stylesheets.
See _xref:features/advanced/stylesheets.adoc[]_ for details.
