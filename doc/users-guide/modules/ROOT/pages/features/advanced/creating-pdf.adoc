== How it works

The user can choose menu:Create PDF from current file[] from the editor's action toolbar to convert the file shown in the current AsciiDoc editor to a PDF using Asciidoctor PDF.

If creation of the PDF file succeeds, the plugin opens the PDF in the system's PDF viewer.
To find out more how to configure the output and formatting, visit https://docs.asciidoctor.org/pdf-converter/latest/convert-to-pdf/.

On Windows, users need to close the PDF viewer first to be able to create a new instance of the PDF as the file would otherwise be locked.

== Version of Asciidoctor PDF

Plugin version 0.37.44+ uses Asciidoctor PDF version 2.3.
To find out about the exact version of Asciidoctor PDF used in the plugin a user has installed, create a minimal PDF and look at the document properties as shown in the PDF viewer. The application property shows the exact version of Asciidoctor PDF used to create the document.

A full history of the different versions of Asciidoctor PDF included in each plugin version is available in https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-intellij-plugin/blob/main/CHANGELOG.adoc[the changelog of the plugin].

== Downloading Asciidoctor PDF support

As of the AsciiDoc Plugin version 0.31.14+, Asciidoctor PDF is no longer included in the plugin as default as it adds approximately 2 MB to the download of the installation and each update.

When creating a PDF for the first time, the plugin will download the necessary dependency.
