= Antora
:description: This plugin support Antora attributes like 'imagesdir' and 'examplesdir'. It also resolves xrefs and includes in the preview.

https://antora.org/[Antora] helps to write and publish documentation web sites.
It allows combining documentation from multiple repositories into a single website.

Each documentation component contains an `antora.yml` file https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.3/standard-directories/[with a common directory structure] with meta information about that component.

== Pre-Requisites

You need to upgrade to version 0.30.31 or later of the plugin.
Initial support has been added in issue https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-intellij-plugin/issues/373[#373].

== Detection of Antora

The plugin will activate Antora support once it finds a file `antora.yml` and a sub-folder `modules`.
Antora will be active for all AsciiDoc files located in folders below such a file.

== Support provided by the plugin

Once the plugin detects Antora, it activates its Antora features.

For `include::[]` and `+xref:[]+` macros the plugin supports the Antora families as long as it can resolve the references in the current project.
For references outside the current module or component it locates `antora.yml` files and find the targets of the references.

It sets multiple attributes to allow referencing files with the current Antora module:

imagesdir:: pointing to `images` of the current module (or `assets/images`, the Antora pre-2.1 style, if that folder exists)

partialsdir:: pointing to `partials` of the current module (or `pages/_partials`, the Antora pre-1.1 style, if that folder exists)

attachmentsdir:: pointing to `attachments` of the current module (or `assets/attachments`, the Antora pre-2.1 style, if that folder exists)

examplesdir:: pointing to `examples` of the current module

page-*:: These and several other intrinsic attributes are supported for the preview like `page-component-version`, `page-module` etc.

Any of these attributes is set only if the directory exists.
While `imagesdir` and `attachmentsdir` use a relative path so that they work best with image and link macros, `examplesdir` and `partialsdir` use an absolute path that works best with includes macros.

In the editor the user can autocomplete filenames using kbd:[Ctrl+Space] and can navigate to a folder or file using kbd:[Ctrl+B].

The preview renders images, includes and links.
It also resolves https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.3/page/reftext-and-navtitle/[reftext and navtitle in the preview^] (new in Antora 2.3)
The user can click on links in the preview and they will open in the editor if they link to a local Antora page.
