= Checking the Grammar for AsciiDoc content
:description: Validate the grammar for the written content.
:navtitle: Checking the Grammar

{description}
This functionality is added via additional plugins.

== How it works

The https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/12175-grazie[Grazie] and https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/16136-grazie-professional[Grazie Professional] plugins add grammar checking for various languages.

Once the plugin is installed, the IDE will highlight spelling and grammar problems in the editor.
Users can also run xref:features/advanced/validation-in-ide.adoc[] or xref:features/advanced/validation-cicd.adoc[Validation during Continuous Integration and Delivery].

== Grazie Lite Plugin

The https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/12175-grazie[Grazie plugin] is pre-installed for most JetBrains IDEs and offers grammar and spell checking for several languages.
While support for English is included, it will detect other languages and offer the download of additional files.
Once it has downloaded these files, spell checking and grammar checking is available for those languages.

This plugin is available for both paid and free versions of IntelliJ.

== Grazie Professional Plugin

NOTE: This plugin is no longer supported in IntelliJ 2025.3 onwards.
Therefore, its support has been removed from the plugin version 0.45.x and later.

The https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/16136-grazie-professional[Grazie Professional] is an optional plugin that needs to be installed by a user to their IDE.

The required-plugin feature of the IDE will display a popup to users when they open a project and a required plugin is not installed.
To add the Grazie Professional plugin to the list of required plugins for a project, follow the instructions about https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/settings-required-plugins.html[Required Plugins] in the online help for the IDE.
Then check in the file `.idea/externalDependencies.xml` to the code repository together with all other files.

When defining such rules, this plugin supports the following scopes:

For now, table headings are also identified as cells.
