The preview of the AsciiDoc plugin supports rendering the diagrams in the preview.
Two different types of diagram renderer are supported: <<asciidoctor-diagram>> and <<kroki>>.

[[asciidoctor-diagram,Asciidoctor Diagram]]
== Using Asciidoctor Diagram

By default, the plugin uses {uri-asciidoctor-diagrams-gh}[Asciidoctor Diagram]
that depends on locally installed tools to generate images (ie. {uri-asciidoctor-diagrams-execs}[executables] available in the `PATH` environment variable).

Asciidoctor Diagram renders the content of the editor including all referenced includes, images and diagrams like PlantUML on the fly.

=== Downloading Asciidoctor Diagram

As of AsciiDoc Plugin version 0.31.14+ Asciidoctor Diagram is no longer included in the plugin as default as it adds approximately 15 MB to the download of the installation and each update.

// see: diagram-placeholder.rb + AsciiDocDownloadNotificationProvider.java
When the preview includes a diagram, the plugin shows an editor notification asking the user to download the necessary dependency.

[[kroki,Kroki]]
== Using Kroki

Alternatively, the plugin supports {uri-kroki}[Kroki] instead of Asciidoctor Diagram to render diagrams.

Use the plugin's settings to enable Kroki:

image::kroki-settings.png[]

When Kroki is enabled, the plugin sends the text diagrams to an instance of Kroki to display them as images in the preview.
By default, it sends the diagrams to the free public cloud instance {uri-kroki}[kroki.io], but users can install Kroki on their own infrastructure.
Once the custom instance is set up, update the server URL in the plugin's settings to point to it.

=== Inline diagrams with Kroki

When using the diagram option `inline`, users will need to set the attribute `allow-uri-read` in the plugin's settings to allow the download of the diagrams at render time.

[WARNING]
====
As Kroki will in inline-mode fetch the diagrams synchronously when preparing the preview, a slow or unavailable internet connection to the user's Kroki server can slow down or break the preview.

To avoid this, consider using `interactive` for Kroki diagrams as an alternative.
See <<interative-vs-inlined>> and <<avoid-flicker>> for a discussion of tradeoffs.
====

== Advanced options

=== PNG-only JavaFX preview

// see: plantuml-png-patch.rb and kroki-extension.rb
As JavaFX has a problem displaying SVG files correctly.
Therefore the plugin displays all diagrams in the JavaFX preview as PNGs, even when the user specifies SVG as the diagram format.

When using IntelliJ 2020.2+ and plugin version 0.31.25+, the JCEF preview will show diagrams as SVGs when the user specifies SVG as the diagram format.

[#interative-vs-inlined]
=== Interactive vs inlined SVGs

SVGs support interactions with the user, for example hovering or links.
This is only available when the user adds the option `interactive` or `inline` to diagrams or SVG images.
See https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#taming-svgs[section "`Taming SVGs`" in the Asciidoctor manual].

[NOTE]
====
Only when an SVG or diagram is inlined, the plugin will redirect clicks on links in the preview to local AsciiDoc files.
====

The following PlantUML example renders a diagram in the preview showing a note "`Link to class-demo.adoc`" with a link.
When the user clicks on the note, the plugin resolves the link `class-demo.html` to the workspace file `class-demo.adoc`.

.Source code for diagram
[source,asciidoc]
-----
[plantuml,demo,svg,opts="inline"]
----
class Demo
note right
[[class-demo.html Link to class-demo.adoc]]
end note
----
-----

.Diagram as displayed in the preview
[plantuml,demo,svg]
----
class Demo
note right
[[class-demo.html Link to class-demo.adoc]]
end note
----

[NOTE]
====
In this documentation the image above is non-interactive, as the target link of the note would not resolve.
====

[#avoid-flicker]
=== Avoid flicker in preview on refresh

Using inlined diagrams instead of interactive diagrams in the preview prevents flickering on refreshed content.
If inlining should be used only for IntelliJ preview, consider a conditional attribute like in the following listing.

[source,plantuml]
-----
\ifdef::env-idea[:plantuml-opts: inline]

[plantuml,demo,svg,opts="{plantuml-opts}"]
----
...
