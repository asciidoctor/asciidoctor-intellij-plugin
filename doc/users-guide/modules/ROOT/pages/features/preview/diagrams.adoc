= Diagrams in the preview
:description: The preview of the AsciiDoc plugin supports rendering the diagrams in the preview. It supports both the Asciidoctor Diagram and the Kroki plugin.

The preview of the AsciiDoc plugin supports rendering the diagrams in the preview.
Two different types of diagram renderer are supported: <<asciidoctor-diagram>> and <<kroki>>.

[[asciidoctor-diagram,Asciidoctor Diagram]]
== Using Asciidoctor Diagram

By default, the plugin uses the extension {uri-asciidoctor-diagrams-gh}[Asciidoctor Diagram]
that depends on locally installed tools to generate images (i.e. {uri-asciidoctor-diagrams-execs}[executables] available in the `PATH` environment variable).

The extension Asciidoctor Diagram renders the content of the editor, including all referenced includes, images and diagrams like PlantUML on the fly.

=== Downloading Asciidoctor Diagram

As of the AsciiDoc Plugin version 0.31.14+, Asciidoctor Diagram is no longer included in the plugin as default as it adds approximately 15 MB to the download of the installation and each update.

// see: diagram-placeholder.rb + AsciiDocDownloadNotificationProvider.java
When the preview includes a diagram, the plugin shows an editor notification asking the user to download the necessary dependency.

include::partial$download-dependencies.adoc[]

[[temp-folder-asciidoctor,Temporary folder _.asciidoctor_ appearing in several places]]
=== Temporary folder _.asciidoctor_ appearing in several places

This is a folder that holds temporary files that are created, for example, for dynamic diagrams.

When running in Asciidoctor's UNSAFE mode, the plugin creates a temporary folder outside the project.
When running in any other mode, Asciidoctor needs to have this folder them relative to the document's folder.

NOTE: Diagrams in the preview when running in any mode other than UNSAFE will only work starting with version 0.33.8.

To avoid checking in these files, consider adding a file path to the ignore file of your version control system.

See below for a _.gitignore_ file placed in the root of the project if the project uses Git as its version control system.

..gitignore
----
**/.asciidoctor/images/*
**/.asciidoctor/diagram/*
----

[[kroki,Kroki]]
== Using Kroki

Alternatively, the plugin supports {uri-kroki}[Kroki] instead of Asciidoctor Diagram to render diagrams.

Use the plugin's settings to enable Kroki:

image::kroki-settings.png[]

When Kroki is enabled, the plugin sends the text diagrams to an instance of Kroki to display them as images in the preview.
By default, it sends the diagrams to the free public cloud instance {uri-kroki}[kroki.io], but users can install Kroki on their own infrastructure.
Once the custom instance is set up, update the server URL in the plugin's settings to point to it.

=== Inline diagrams with Kroki

When using the diagram option `inline`, users will need to set the attribute `allow-uri-read` in the plugin's settings to allow the download of the diagrams at render time.

[WARNING]
====
As Kroki will in inline-mode fetch the diagrams synchronously while preparing the preview, a slow or unavailable internet connection to the user's Kroki server can slow down or break the preview.

To avoid this, consider using `interactive` for Kroki diagrams as an alternative.
See <<interative-vs-inlined>> and <<avoid-flicker>> for a discussion of tradeoffs.
====

== Using embedded Mermaid support

As an experimental option in plugin version 0.38.1+, there's an embedded Mermaid support that is embedded in the plugin and will render Mermaid diagrams within the IDE without external helpers.

To enable the support, toggle the checkbox menu:Enable built-in Mermaid Diagrams support[] in the plugin's settings.

This is currently only supported for Mermaid diagrams, and only for the JCEF preview.

== Advanced options

=== PNG-only JavaFX preview

// see: plantuml-png-patch.rb and kroki-extension.rb
JavaFX has a problem displaying SVG files correctly.
Therefore, the plugin displays all diagrams in the JavaFX preview as PNGs even when the user specifies SVG as the diagram format.

When using IntelliJ 2020.2+ and plugin version 0.31.25+, the JCEF preview will show diagrams as SVGs when the user specifies SVG as the diagram format.

[#interative-vs-inlined]
=== Interactive vs inlined SVGs

SVGs support interactions with the user such as hovering or links.
This is only available when the user adds the option `interactive` or `inline` to diagrams or SVG images.
Only when an SVG or diagram is inlined, the plugin will redirect clicks on links in the preview to local AsciiDoc files.
See https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#taming-svgs[section "`Taming SVGs`" in the Asciidoctor manual].

[WARNING]
====
* When using existing SVGs images in Asciidoctor, use `**opts=**inline` to inline existing SVGs
* When using Kroki, use `**opts=**inline` and set `allow-uri-read` in the plugin's settings
* When using Asciidoctor Diagram, use `**svg-type=**inline` to inline generated SVG
* As this requires SVG support in the preview, this only works with the JCEF preview.

The following PlantUML example renders a diagram in the preview showing a note "`Link to class-demo.adoc`" with a link.
When the user clicks on the note, the plugin resolves the link `class-demo.html` to the workspace file `class-demo.adoc`.

.Source code for diagram
[source,asciidoc]
-----
// setting both opts and svg-type to make it work with both the Kroki plugin and the Asciidoctor Diagram plugin
[plantuml,demo,svg,opts="inline",svg-type="inline"]
----
class Demo
note right
[[class-demo.html Link to class-demo.adoc]]
end note
----

.Diagram as displayed in the preview
[plantuml,demo,svg]
----

[[class-demo.html Link to class-demo.adoc]]
end note
----

// TODO: Try out https://gitlab.com/djencks/asciidoctor-antora-kref
// it might be able to use a "kref" inside Kroki diagrams

[NOTE]
====
In this documentation the image above is non-interactive, as the target link of the note would not resolve.

[#avoid-flicker]
=== Avoid flicker in preview on refresh

Using inlined diagrams instead of interactive diagrams in the preview prevents flickering on refreshed content.
If inlining should be used only for IntelliJ preview, consider a conditional attribute like in the following listing.

[source,plantuml]
-----
\ifdef::env-idea[:plantuml-opts: inline]

// setting both opts and svg-type to make it work with both Kroki and Asciidoctor Diagram
[plantuml,demo,svg,opts="{plantuml-opts}",svg-type="{plantuml-opts}"]
----
