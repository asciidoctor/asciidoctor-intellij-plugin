= Could not find executable to render diagrams
:description: To render diagram previews, 'dot' or other helpers need to be in the path or specified as a document attribute. See this guide how to add or enable Kroki.
:uri-kroki: https://kroki.io

https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-diagram[Asciidoctor Diagram] adds capabilities to render diagrams in an AsciiDoc document.

{description}

== Symptom: Could not find the 'dot' (or other) executable

When adding a diagram to the AsciiDoc file, the preview doesn't show diagram, but an error message like:

====
Could not find the 'dot' executable in PATH; add it to the PATH or specify its location using the 'graphvizdot' document attribute
====

== Cause: Helper executable not found

When using https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-diagram[asciidoctor-diagram], some diagrams will need external helper applications like for example https://www.graphviz.org/[Graphviz] for creating the diagram.

== Remedies

=== Remedy 1: Adding executable to PATH or document attribute

Most of the time you can make diagrams work by adding the executable (like Graphiz' dot-executable) to the PATH environment variable.

If this doesn't work for you, there are other possibilities depending on the diagram type.
PlantUML will search for Graphviz using multiple well-known folders and will look for the executable.
If an environment variable `GRAPHVIZ_DOT` exists, it will use the executable stated there.

If you still receive the error message, go to the settings of the AsciiDoc plugin, and add it as an attribute.
For the error message above the attribute is `graphvizdot`. The value is the full path including the executable, for example `C:\Program Files (x86)\Graphviz2.38\bin\dot.exe`

=== Remedy 2: Use Kroki as a cloud-based renderer for diagrams

This plugin supports {uri-kroki}[Kroki] to render diagrams.
Kroki is available as cloud based service and as a self-hosted service.

See xref:features/preview/diagrams.adoc[section about Kroki in the chapter "`Diagrams in the preview`"].
