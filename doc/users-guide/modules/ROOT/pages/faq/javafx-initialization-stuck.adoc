= JavaFX initialization stuck
:description: IDE stuck when initializing JavaFX on Linux/GTK3 desktop

== Symptoms

The IDE is either stuck or (with newer versions of the plugin) will show a message "`JavaFX initialization is stuck`"

== Environment

When you're running IntelliJ on Linux with a GTK3 based desktop (like Ubuntu 19.04) using the JetBrains Runtime based on OpenJDK 8, the following will happen:

0.28.18 and later::
The AsciiDoc plugin will show a notification "`JavaFX initialization is stuck`"

0.28.17 and earlier::
The IDE will freeze once you open a AsciiDoc document with the plugin. Actually this will happen for any JavaFX based preview, including the IntelliJ Markdown plugin.

*If something like this happens to you in a different environment, please open a https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-intellij-plugin/issues[GitHub issue^] to investigate it.*

== Cause

The JetBrains Runtime based on OpenJDK 8 (aka JBR8) doesn't include jre64/lib/amd64/libglassgtk3.so that is needed to run JavaFX in GTK3 environments.

Upon the first initialization of JavaFX it will become stuck.
Newer versions oft the plugin identify this situation and instead of hanging up the IDE will present a warning message.

=== Remedy

Download the Build of IntelliJ that includes the JetBrains Runtime based on OpenJDK 11 (JBR11).
Once the IDE uses this version, go to the plugin settings and ensure that it uses JavaFX or JCEF for the best preview experience.
