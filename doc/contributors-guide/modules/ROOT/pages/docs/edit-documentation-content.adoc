= Edit documentation content

== Prerequisites

For small changes you can use your web browser and the web based text editor of GitHub.

The preview of GitHub doesn't take into account the Antora macros, therefore consider using the IntelliJ AsciiDoc plugin for changes.

Follow these steps to change the documentation content on the plugin's homepage with just the browser:

. Click on the "`Edit this page`" link on the documentation website of the plugin
