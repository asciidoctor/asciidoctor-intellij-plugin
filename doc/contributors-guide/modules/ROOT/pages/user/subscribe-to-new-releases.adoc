Or the implementation misses a corner case that no-one has thought of before.

_You can help by testing preview releases!_

== Subscribe to GitHub notifications

The maintainers publish new releases of the plugin on GitHub a few days of weeks before they are published on the IntelliJ plugin repository.
The release notes contain information about the newly included functionality or fixed bugs.

On GitHub, you can subscribe to a repository to receive email notifications once a preview release is available.
Use the watch-control on the https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-intellij-plugin[GitHub page of the plugin] and choose "`Releases only`" to get emails only when a new pre-release is available.
